Founded in 1817 by the Dutch East Indies government, Kimia Farma is Indonesia's first pharmaceutical company. Initially named NV Chemicalien Handle Rathkamp & Co, it was nationalized in 1958 and renamed PNF Bhinneka Kimia Farma. The company transitioned to PT Kimia Farma (Persero) in 1971 and became a publicly listed company in 2001, establishing itself as an integrated healthcare provider contributing significantly to Indonesia's health sector.

In 2020, 90.025% of Kimia Farma's shares were transferred to PT Bio Farma (Persero), forming the State-Owned Pharmaceutical Holding. Along with this restructuring, the companyâ€™s name changed to PT Kimia Farma Tbk. With decades of experience, Kimia Farma continues to play a vital role in national health development.
